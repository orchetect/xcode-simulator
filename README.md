# setup-xcode-simulator

This action is intended to dynamically find the best available pre-installed Xcode device simulator for macOS images in GitHub Actions.

## Motivation

Relevant Xcode device simulator names and platform versions are an ever-moving hamster wheel. In order to maintain GitHub Actions CI pipelines across dozens of open-source repositories, over the years I have gradually tweaked and refined scripts to aid in this process. 

Over time, numerous quirks and edge cases of both GitHub actions runners and how Xcode behaves has led to a laundry list of steps involved in successfully preparing a device simulator for use on runners.

This acton is designed as a one-stop shop to select and prepare a device simulator, primarily with the intention of running unit tests on the simulator.

## Complete Examples

### Build and Test a Swift Package for iOS

Prepare an iOS device simulator (defaults to iPhone) using the latest device and operating system version in order to test a Swift Package. Beforehand, refresh simulators and download an appropriate simulator if one is not yet installed.

> [!TIP]
>
> Separating the build and test phases into separate steps is recommended for organization and clarity.
>
> Building (unlike testing) typically does not require a simulator destination and a generic destination can be supplied.

```yaml
